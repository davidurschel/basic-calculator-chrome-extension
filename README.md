Source Code of the Basic Calculator chrome extension

A simple calculator extension that works on any chromium based web browser allowing users to Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, and Exponentiate without the painful process of switching tabs allowing for a less cluttered user experience.

This project gave me experience with the procedure of creating an extension for google chrome and getting it published on the chrome web store.

Add it directly from the chrome web store and try it right now: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/basic-calculator/cahgbmoohheneohjejjaladliemlmbfg/
